		<h1>Ubuntu Certified Public Cloud</h1>
		<p>Ubuntu is enormously popular with providers delivering public cloud services today. Together with its significant developer mindshare, its favourable licensing model and policy of regular updates have made it the platform of choice for cloud guests the world over.</p>
		<p>If you operate a public cloud or you&rsquo;re considering launching one, the Ubuntu Certified Public Cloud programme lets you make certified Ubuntu Server images available to these users, along with management, monitoring and commercial support from Canonical &mdash; all of which represent additional revenue opportunities.</p>
